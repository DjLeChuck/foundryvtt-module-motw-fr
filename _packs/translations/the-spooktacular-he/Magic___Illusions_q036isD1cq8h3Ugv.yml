  <p>You can <strong>cast confounding spells</strong>. When you weave an
  illusion, roll +Weird.&nbsp;</p>
success: >-
  <p><strong>Sur un 10+</strong>, everyone is fooled, they are either led in
  a direction of your choice or you and those you choose escape
  undetected.&nbsp;</p>
partial: >-
  <p><strong>Sur un 7-9</strong>, it doesn&rsquo;t quite work: misdirect or
  escape as a 10+ result, but the Keeper chooses one: someone isn&rsquo;t
  fooled, or you gain unwelcome attention.&nbsp;</p>
failure: <p><strong>En cas d’échec</strong>, it goes badly as magic always does.</p>
