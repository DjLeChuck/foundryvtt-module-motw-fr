  <p>If you <strong>need to buy something, sell something, or hire
  someone</strong>, roll +Charm. On a 10+ you know just the person who will be
  interested. On a 7-9 you know the only person who can do it, but
  there&rsquo;s a complication. Pick one: you owe them; they screwed you over;
  you screwed them over. On a miss, the only person who can help is someone
  who absolutely hates you.</p>
