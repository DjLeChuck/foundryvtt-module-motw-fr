name: Sacred Oath
description: >-
  <p>You may bind yourself to a single goal, forsaking something during your
  quest (e.g. speech, all sustenance but bread and water, alcohol, lying, sex,
  etc). Get the Keeper&rsquo;s agreement on this - it should match the goal in
  importance and difficulty.</p>

  <p>While you keep your oath and work towards your goal, mark experience at
  the end of every session and get +1 on any rolls that directly help achieve
  the goal.</p>

  <p>If you break the oath, take -1 ongoing until you have atoned.</p>
