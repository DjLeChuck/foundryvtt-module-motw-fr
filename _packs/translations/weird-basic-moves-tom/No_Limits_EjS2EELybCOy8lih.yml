  <p>When you <strong>push your physical body past its limits</strong>, roll
  +Weird.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of this move, “physical possibility” means “conceivably
  possible for a human.”</p>

  <p>For example:</p>

  <ul>

  <li><strong>Physically</strong> <strong>Possible:</strong> Lift an SUV, Jump
  over a truck, Punch through a wall.</li>

  <li><strong>Not Physically Possible:</strong> Lift a building, Fly, Punch a
  blast of energy at a foe.</li>

  </ul>
success: >-
  <p><strong>On a 10 or more</strong>, your body obeys your will, to the
  limits of physical possibility (see below), for a moment.<br><br></p>

  <h4>Advanced No Limits</h4>

  <p><strong>On a 12 or more</strong>, you can continue acting at your
  body&rsquo;s limits for 30 seconds.</p>
partial: >-
  <p><strong>On a 7-9</strong>, you do it but choose one consequence:
  suffer 1-harm, take &ndash;1 forward, or you need to rest right now.</p>
failure: <p><strong>On a miss</strong>, something goes horribly wrong.</p>
