description: >-
  <p>You have a few attack spells you can use as weapons.&nbsp;When you use
  these spells to&nbsp;<strong>kick some ass</strong>, roll
  +Weird&nbsp;instead of +Tough.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the situation may require&nbsp;you to&nbsp;<strong>act under
  pressure</strong>&nbsp;to cast your spell without&nbsp;problems.</p>

  <p>Your combat spells can combine any of your base spells&nbsp;with any of
  your effects.</p>
success: >-
  <p><strong>On a 10+</strong>, choose one extra effect:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>You gain the advantage: take +1 forward, or give +1 forward to
  another hunter.</li>

  <li>You inflict terrible harm (+1 harm).</li>

  <li>You suffer less harm (-1 harm).</li>

  <li>You force them where you want them.</li>

  </ul>

  <p><br><strong>ADVANCED: On a 12+</strong>&nbsp;instead pick an enhanced
  effect:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>You completely hold the advantage.&nbsp;All hunters involved in the
  fight get +1 forward.</li>

  <li>You suffer no harm at all.</li>

  <li>Your attack inflicts double the normal harm.</li>

  <li>Your attack drives the enemy away in a rout.</li>

  </ul>
partial: >-
  <p><strong>On a 7+</strong>, you and whatever you&rsquo;re fighting
  inflict harm on each other. The amount of harm is based on the
  established dangers in the game. That usually means you inflict the harm
  rating of your weapon and your enemy inflicts their attack&rsquo;s harm
  rating on you.</p>
failure: >-
  <p><strong>On a miss</strong>, you get your ass kicked instead. You
  suffer harm or get captured, but don&rsquo;t inflict any harm back.</p>
