  <p>When you <strong>read a bad situation</strong>, you can <strong>open up
  your third eye</strong> for a moment to take in extra information. Take +1
  hold on any result of 7 or more, plus you can see invisible things. On a
  miss, you may still get 1 hold, but you&rsquo;re exposed to supernatural
  danger. Unfiltered hidden reality is rough on the mind!</p>
